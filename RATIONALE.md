# Why this initiative

The discussion of the Italian Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (henceforth PNRR) is to be carried before its final version is sent to Brussels.

While under separate articles discussed its origins, criticalities, and evolution, this repository has just a documentary value.

The purpose is simple: once the document is finalized in Italy and sent to Brussels
* 1. track its evolution (each component will become a "thread" to follow through issues)
* 2. associate the projects to each measure within the document
* 3. associate each project with its own specific measures.

Of the three elements, the expectation is to have to cover just the first one, as for the other two there have been already annouunces about the use of #open #data.

To this end, for the "data" part, i.e. linking proposals to evolutions, will expand the dataset already posted on Kaggle.com/robertolofaro:

[PNRR NextGenerationEU in Italy - presentations](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/pnrr-nextgenerationeu-in-italy-presentations)

As for the points 2. and 3., if other sources will develop the associated themes, will just add to the existing Kaggle dataset further "catalog" files, i.e. links to the relevant data sources.

If needed, will instead create further datasets.

# Expected lifecycle

Optimistic: end of 2021, if the framework already defined by the PNRR (and the Italian fund created to live "alongside" the PNRR) will not change substantially.

Pessimistic: 2030 or until the end of the funding phase (considering delays and other initiatives, as well as potential linkup with the next budget and ongoing sustainability initiatives).

# Caveats

As #NextGenerationEU is introducing some structural changes also on in the approach used by the EU to procure and distribute funding, and the ECB itself has adopted a more pro-active role, actually the PNRR could become a "testing ground" for a corresponding set of changes also in Italy on the way initiatives are proposed, discussed, planned, executed, monitored.

Therefore, more than a "one-off" initiative, despite its size, the PNRR and associated measures could introduce something closer to the traditional "continuous improvement" cycle represented by e.g. the [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) cycle, i.e. each initiative is a first step in a journey, not a "project" (with a charter, a start, an end, and deliverables).

Albeit, of course, each initiative could "spawn" multiple projects both to support itself (imagine building the organizational infrastructure to support the initiative), and to "test waters" for further initiatives that would require separate allocation of priorities and resources.

As an example, have a look at a [fictional case study on a compliance initiative to be delivered in few months](https://issuu.com/robertolofaro/stacks/86e5ef3fcb0c4f4dac7cd1b2cfef33a4) that started publishing in 2015 and completed in 2018 (after few years of "hold" due to incompatibility with ongoing activities).
